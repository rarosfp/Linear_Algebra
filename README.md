# Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is my first attempt to upload programs in the Python programming language. I create the same tools in the domain of linear algebra in this repository.

# Matrix Multiplication

In the first program I uploaded, named mat_mult.py, I made a program in which the users enter the dimensions of the matrices they want to multiply, and the program examines whether the multiplication of matrices is done and outputs the result with the corresponding new dimensions.

You can learn more about linear algebra at the following URLs:

UPDATE NEW BETA (b-01):

-Fix bug with the second column of the matrix multiplication  
-Add a new addition, now the program checks if the user enters the correct number of observations according to the dimensions of the table; otherwise, it asks the user to enter the n number of observations from the beginning.

# Required python modules

Make sure you have the following python packages installed before running the application:

numpy (https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)

# Following projects 

The projects that follow will concentrate on the inversion of a matrix as well as reading program files with data and creating matrices of the databases.
